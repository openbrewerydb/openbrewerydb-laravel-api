## 🍻 Open Brewery DB API

This is a WIP/POC to move the API over to a Laravel backend.

### 🤔 Considerations

- If we're rewriting the API, should this be "v2"?
  - Use https://spatie.be/docs/laravel-query-builder/v5/introduction so we match the json API specs http://jsonapi.org/ for filtering data from a query string.
- If we're not rewriting the API it should mirror v1 and any changes can be a v2.

### 📞 API Docs

Still working on 100% coverage but API specs can be found in the wiki for now, Swagger docs are planned.
