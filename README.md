### API Documentation

API specs can be found in the [documentation](https://www.openbrewerydb.org/documentation) for now. More formal documentation, like Swagger/OpenAPI, is planned for the future.

### 🏃‍♂️ Developing

Open Brewery DB API utilizes [Laravel Sail](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/sail) to create a Docker development environment. As a result, [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is the only prerequisite to get started.

#### 🥇 First Time Setup

This will build the Docker container, install all dependencies, and set up your local environment.

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/openbrewerydb/openbrewerydb-laravel-api.git`
2.  Navigate into the project directory: `cd openbrewerydb-laravel-api`
3.  Run the install script: `./install.sh`

#### 🔄️ Continuing Development

After the first-time setup, you can manage the development environment with these commands:

-   **Start the environment**: `./vendor/bin/sail up -d`
-   **Stop the environment**: `./vendor/bin/sail down`

#### 👇 Importing Data

The database needs to be populated with brewery data from the official dataset.

1.  To import the latest brewery data, run: `./vendor/bin/sail artisan app:import-breweries`
2.  To refresh the search index after importing, run: `./vendor/bin/sail artisan app:refresh-search-indexes`

### 🧪 Running Tests

The application has a comprehensive test suite built with Pest.

-   To run all tests, use: `./vendor/bin/sail artisan test`
-   To run tests with code coverage, use the provided script: `./run-tests-with-coverage.sh` (The report will be generated in the `coverage/` directory).

### ✨ Code Style

This project uses [Laravel Pint](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/pint) to enforce a consistent code style.

-   To automatically format your code, run: `./vendor/bin/sail pint`
